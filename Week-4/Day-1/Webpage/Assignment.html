                <p>
                     Cherry Blossom Flower Shop was founded in 2020 with a simple dream: 
                    to make the world a more beautiful place, one flower at a time. 
                    What started as a small family business has grown into a beloved 
                    local shop that serves hundreds of happy customers every month.
